#### presentation:

This is a music authoring Tool

made for small artists that want promote their work and accept donations


if you want to do the same thing as Imogen is doing
you can use this app to do so!

you can publish your new release to the public

via the blockchain
via key signing

this app generates you a key (a private key) that you can use to author content
the network of computers will recognize you as the oauthor of the 

alongside this key you have the corresponding Artist address of this key
it's like an email address, except people can send you money with that

the key instead is used for the blockchain to recognize that YOU and only YOU are the author of the content (music track)

enough for the talk
i'm going to write this message

this message contains also a magnet link so people can connect and share the song between themselves

my artist address is saved into the transaction

after downloading this track people can donate to the artist money







THANKS TO IMOGEN WITH ALL MY HEART TO MAKING THIS REAL

MAKING PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT BLOCKCHAIN IS

- that we need to gather ideas
- build programs
- change the world
- starting from the music industry
